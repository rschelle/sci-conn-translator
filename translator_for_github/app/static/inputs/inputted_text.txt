Any ordinary person looking at the rainbow-colored map of Canberra, Australia, would see just a map—or maybe, the following day’s weather forecast. But Patrice de Caritat sees something entirely different: a detailed landscape of soils, with different colors revealing areas of earth rich in elements like carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The geochemist has spent more than 2 decades making geochemical atlases to help other researchers track down rare minerals or understand an area’s changing environment. Now, a new group is showing an interest in these maps: law enforcement agencies. De Caritat’s first call came in 2011, from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. They asked him whether maps like his could be used to track down soil from criminal investigations—and perhaps even tie suspects to crime scenes. “I had never really thought that this could be used for anything of that nature,” says de Caritat, who works at the Australian research agency Geoscience Australia. “It lit a spark in my head.” Over the next several years, de Caritat developed new methods to determine the origin of soil samples with Australia’s National Centre for Forensic Studies.
